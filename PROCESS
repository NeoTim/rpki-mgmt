#
# RPKI Master should be internal (to your organization) available only.
# RPKI slaves (publication servers) should hold the publicly available data
#   and should offer rsync access to the published data.
#
# The rsync daemon should run from inetd/xinetd.
# Periodically the rsyncd configuration will be updated to point at an updated
#   copy of all RPKI published data.
# Scheduled jobs on the RPKI-master will create and push to all RPKI-slaves
#   the updated RPKI data.
# After all publication servers are updated, rsyncd configuration files will be
#   moved into place pointing to the updated content.
#
# Actions on the RPKI-master:
1) support changes to the RPKI data for an organization.
2) maintain a local repository.
3) trigger on change of RPKI data a data push to the slaves.
4) push publication data over rsync to all slaves

#
# Actions on the RPKI-slaves:
1) provide a writable destination for RPKI-master to push all content on
   every refresh/update event.
2) move all refresh/update data to a newly created location for the public
   rsync service to serve.
3) Ensure that all RPKI-slaves serve the same content at the same time.
